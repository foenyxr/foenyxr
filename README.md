## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Pranjall**. 

### I am a Technical Designer with expertise in integrating design with programming, experienced in Level Design and a passion for creating immersive story-driven game experiences. 

Currently, working on my skills as a Technical Game Designer and Web Developer.


I have worked on several game jams and personal projects where I got hands-on experience with level design, coding and blueprints, gameplay mechanics and features, world settings, asset placements, and 2D/3D design.


During my free time, I love to work on digital art and website development. Currently, I am playing Genshin Impact and Hogwarts Legacy.
